> _(Not) a Discord alternative._

**NeuroLAN** is an open-source messaging and voice-chat platform — or at least, it aims to be.

## Why *NeuroLAN* ❓

When thinking of a name for this project, the first thing that came to mind was the neural networks in our brains. One of my goals is to connect people like neural networks — anytime, anywhere.

At first, I shortened “Neural” to “Neura,” then changed it to “Neuro” to make it sound cooler. (It has nothing to do with AI Neuro — but she’s cool.)  
The "LAN" part? It's just the last three letters of a random name my brother suggested.

## FAQ ❔

**Q:** Why make this project when there are better alternatives like Discord?  
**A:** Discord is censored in my country, and I got tired of turning on VPN just to send a message.

**Q:** Can this really be a Discord alternative?  
**A:** Probably not. I don't have much time. But if I ever do — who knows?
